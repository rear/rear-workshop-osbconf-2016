The RPM package rear-workshop contains customized local.conf files
used during the REAR workshop lab exercises.
It cannot be installed without the 'rear' package as the directoy
where it stores its lab configuration files is /etc/rear/workshop

We can organize workshop on conferences (free of charge) or at your
premises with a customized content (consultancy fee).
